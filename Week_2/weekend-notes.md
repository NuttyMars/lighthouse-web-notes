## OOP (continued)

->Private vs Public (Classes)

In some languages, properties can be made private, which means that they can't be accessed outside of the class that they're created in. In JavaScript there is no way of making something private, but if we add an _ to the start of a property name, other developers will know that they shouldn't access it directly.

->Single Responsibility Principle

The single responsibility principle states that a class should be responsible for a single part of the app's functionality, giving it only one reason to change. Or more simply, a class should only have one job.

->Inheritance

Use inheritance to reduce duplicate code and share behaviour between classes

>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm where we use objects to encapsulate (group) data and behaviour. These two things become properties of those objects.


>**Why do we do this? What's it all for?**
>
>1. To reduce duplicated code (reusability)
>2. To break code up into sensibly-divided units (modularity)
>
>Why do we need to do that? Because real software gets big (tens of thousands of lines of code or more); having a paradigm to give us conventions and techniques to organize and manage the code is paramount!
>
>OOP does not *need* classes!
>It's just how it's usually implemented in other purely OOP languages
