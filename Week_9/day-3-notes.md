## Debugging in Rails

- Use the rails server log to locate which template or partial renders the element, so we know where the HTML changes will need to be made

- Use the Element Inspector in the DevTools to find the appropriate file/location for the CSS definition

- use 'raise' method to print an error or a variable as an error
