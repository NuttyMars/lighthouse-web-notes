## Trees

-> exmple [here](./trees.js)

-> composed of:
  - nodes = a key-value entity
  - edges = connections between nodes

>! The node at the very top of the tree is called the root node and the nodes on the very bottom are called the leaf nodes.

>Every node except for the root node has a single parent node. Every node that is not a leaf node has 1 or more children nodes.

>All children with the same parent are siblings.

! We can build a tree out of anything as long as the nodes have a single parent and many children:
  - parent
    - node (data)
      -children

! Examples of trees we use:
- browser's DOM
- the file system
