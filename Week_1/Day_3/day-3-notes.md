## For...of and For...in loops

* #### ARRAYS
of -> returns values
in -> returns indexes

* #### OBJECTS
of -> will throw error
in -> returns keys

## Objects

* Contain key-value pairs; each key maps to a value
* Contain keys which are always strings (or symbols, but it's less common and not important right now)
* Have unique keys; the same key cannot appear twice in an object
* Have their keys point to values which can be of any type

### Object Keys

* Keys are always strings
* Each key is unique (can only occur once in the object)
* Each key is associated with exactly one value. (Note that technically, an array or another object would count as "one value" here, even though they contain other values.)

## Methods

`Object.keys(...)` returns an array of keys
`Object.values(...)` returns an array of values
!helpful for looping through objects
