! backticks make text look like `code`

! 3 opening backticks and 3 closing backticks can enclose a whole block of code (can specify language right after opening backticks)

* = unordered lists (indentation changes bullet style)

[link text](url here)

! header sizes run from # = h1 to ###### = h6


## CLI arguments

-> process.argv = an array that passes Node.js arguments
  * first element = file system path to the node exe
  * second element = name of the js file being processed
  * third element and forwards = arguments passed by user

## Assert method of console

`console.assert` = will print nothing if the assertion is `true`, will print `"Assertion failed"` if assertion is `false`

## Shortcuts

`Ctrl + W` (VSCode, Chrome) = close the current tab
`Ctrl + T` (Terminal, Chrome, Finder) = create new tab
`Ctrl + F` (VSCode) = deep search; can use regex
`Ctrl + Shift + Tab` = switch between open tabs
`Alt + up/down` = moves the whole line
`Home/end` = jumps to end/start of line

`Ctrl + arrows` = jump to end of line?? (for me it jumps to end of word)
`Ctrl + home/end` = jumps to start end of file
`Ctrl + ~` = switch between windows of same app (not working!!)
